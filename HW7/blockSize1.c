/****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Notice that the array is an array of characters.  This means that
 *  each item in the cache is exactly 1 byte.  This makes it easy to
 *  identify data items that will or will not conflict in the cache.
 *  For example, in an 8KB direct-mapped cache, array bytes 0 and 8192
 *  will conflict.
 *
 *  This program simply iterates through each byte in the cache NUM_LOOPS
 *  times.
 *
 * Declaring the local variables as "register" variables encourages
 * the compiler to keep the values of these variables in a register,
 * thereby reducing their effect on the cache hit rate.
