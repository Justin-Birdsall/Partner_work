We have 3 inputs for this table B A0 and A1 we don't have to worry about clock since it isn't called for in the problem. We see that A0 goes to a not gate then into an and gate along with the B input. It also goes into a xor gate. So B and A can only be true when B == 1 and A0 == 0 thus making the first four rows and last two rows in the truth table irrelevant for A0n+1. The only time the condition A0 == 0 adn B == 1 is true for A0n+1 are the 5th and 6 rows. Thus, sending the input through the register making the wire true. Now lets look at the A1n+1. We mentioned earlier that A0 goes into the gate and the other input is A1. Xor is a mutally exclusive gate. Meaning that it can only be true when neither inputs are same (01 10 == true)(00 11 == false). Out of 8 inputs this happens 4 times rows 2,3, 6, 7. Since those conditions are met on those rows it will pass the 1 signal making An1+1 true. Promblem complete.
